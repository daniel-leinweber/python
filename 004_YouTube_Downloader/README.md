# YouTube-Downloader
The YouTube-Downloader is a CLI tool to download YouTube Videos or Playlists. 

**ATTENTION: Downloading videos from YouTube is in breach of YouTube's Terms of Service!!**
*This tool was solely created to download videos that are my personal property*

## Motivation
I wanted to quickly download some videos from YouTube that I had uploaded some time ago, without the need to use any Website or third-party tool.
So I created a small CLI tool that is able to do the job.

## Technologies used
- Python3
- pytube
- argparse

## How to use
You can list the possible CLI arguments with `--help`.
